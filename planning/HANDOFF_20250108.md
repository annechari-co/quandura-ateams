# Development Handoff - January 8, 2025

## Current State: PAUSED

Pausing to research:
- Steve Yegge's "Ghost Town" agent framework
- Agent-specific language system concepts

---

## What's Done

### Core Engine ✅
- Memory models with 4-layer architecture (`backend/app/models/memory.py`)
- Memory storage with PostgreSQL + ChromaDB support (`backend/app/memory/`)
- Librarian agent for knowledge retrieval (`backend/app/agents/librarian.py`)
- Judge agent for external validation (`backend/app/agents/judge.py`)
- Base agents (triage, executor) (`backend/app/agents/`)
- Orchestrator + checkpointer (`backend/app/orchestrator/`)
- REST APIs for missions and memory (`backend/app/api/`)
- Database migrations (`backend/alembic/versions/001_initial_tables.py`)

### Project Setup ✅
- Repo created: https://github.com/annechari-co/quandura-ateams
- Parallel development plan: `planning/PARALLEL_DEV.md`
- Docker Compose for PostgreSQL: `docker-compose.yml`
- Environment template: `backend/.env.example`

---

## What Was In Progress

### Environment Validation (Step 1 of BUILD_PLAN.md)
- Docker Desktop was being started
- **Blocker:** Port 5432 already in use (local PostgreSQL running)
- **Fix needed:** Either stop local PostgreSQL or change docker-compose port

### Next Commands to Run
```bash
# Option A: Stop local PostgreSQL
brew services stop postgresql  # if using Homebrew

# Option B: Change port in docker-compose.yml to 5433
# Then update backend/.env: DATABASE_URL=postgresql://quandura:quandura@localhost:5433/quandura

# Then:
cd quandura
docker-compose up -d
cd backend
uv run alembic upgrade head
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
# Test at http://localhost:8000/docs
```
